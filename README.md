# Restaurant-Market-Intelligence-SQL

Restaurant Industry Market Intelligence Report
Strategic Analysis of the US Top 250 & Independence 100
Executive Summary
This project analyzes market saturation and unit-level efficiency across the U.S. restaurant landscape. By integrating disparate datasets (Large Chains vs. Independent Legends), I developed an Adaptive Growth Model to identify market disruptors and at-risk incumbents.

## Key Business Insights
Segment Efficiency Gap: While the "Steak" category leads in Average Unit Volume (AUV), the "Chicken" segment shows the highest velocity for new market disruptors.

The "Disruptor" Identification: By re-calibrating performance benchmarks for the Chicken segment ($1M+ AUV), I identified Jollibee and Chicken Salad Chick as high-growth disruptors, significantly outperforming the industry average YOY growth of 1.6%.

Risk Mitigation: Developed a SQL-based tagging system to flag "At-Risk Laggards"—brands showing negative YOY growth despite high unit counts—providing a lead-generation tool for competitive displacement.

Technical Skills Demonstrated
Advanced SQL: Subqueries and complex CASE statements for business logic.

Data Normalization: Merging datasets with 1,000x scale differences and cleaning "dirty" string data for numeric analysis.
